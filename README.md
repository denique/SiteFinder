1. Modules found in System

a. Home/Main screen
	-This is seen when the user searches the website. Consists of an introductory
	 page with the name of the website and site logo.

b. Search
	-This section is adjacent to the home screen, which is found by dragging the 
	 cursor to the right of the screen from the home page. An input box can be 
	 located where the user can enter the room name they wish to access (e.g. FST 113)

c. Search Results/Maps
	-If the search is successful and the room images does exist in the system's
	 database, the pertinent images will be returned (map from main entrance, location
	 within faculty, and the entrance of the room. This is viewed by further
	 moving the cursor to the right. 

d. New Room Request
	-Move the cursor even further to the right and there will be a form the user can
	 fill out in order to request that a new room be added to the system and made 
	 searchable int he future. 

2. Installation Instructions

	-No installation is needed. The website simply needs to be opened on a web browser
	 (perferably Google Chrome as this was the browser most used in development). Later
	 versions (within the last 2 years) of Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer will also
	 suffice and these are the only software required, and can be downloaded and set up quite 
	 easily on the device being utilized.
